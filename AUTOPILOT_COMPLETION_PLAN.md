# Autopilot Completion Plan - All Remaining Topics

## Strategy
Due to iteration limits, I'll build topics in batches:
- **Batch 1:** Topics 2-3 (Foundation concepts)
- **Batch 2:** Topics 4-5 (Breaking chains)
- **Batch 3:** Topics 6-7 (Core beliefs)
- **Batch 4:** Topics 8-9 (Unity & practical)
- **Batch 5:** Topic 10 (Path forward)

Each topic will have:
- Introduction
- 5-8 key ayahs with full WBW
- Explanations
- Real-life example
- Reflection questions

## Current Session: Building Topics 2-3

### Key Ayahs:
1. **51:56** - Created to worship Me
2. **67:2** - Test who is best in deed
3. **29:2-3** - Can't just say "we believe" without being tested
4. **103:1-3** - Mankind in loss except...
5. **23:115** - Did you think We created you uselessly?
6. **18:7** - Test which is best in deeds

### Example:
Person thinks success = money/career. Dies rich but never worshipped properly. On DoJ realizes: "I succeeded in dunya but FAILED in my actual purpose."
