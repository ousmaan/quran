## SECTION 1: Time Perception on Day of Judgment

### Ayah 1: 10:45 - Yunus
**Message:** Life will feel like just one hour of a day

### Ayah 2-4: 23:112-114 - Al-Mu'minun (Complete passage)
**Message:** Direct conversation - "How long?" "A day or part of a day" - "You stayed only a little, if only you knew!"

### Ayah 5: 30:55 - Ar-Rum
**Arabic:** وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ يُقْسِمُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ مَا لَبِثُوا۟ غَيْرَ سَاعَةٍۢ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ كَانُوا۟ يُؤْفَكُونَ
**Translation:** And the Day the Hour appears the criminals will swear they had remained but an hour. Thus they were deluded.
**Key Point:** Criminals will SWEAR they only stayed an hour - this is how deluded they were!

### Ayah 6: 79:46 - An-Nazi'at
**Arabic:** كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُوٓا۟ إِلَّا عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَىٰهَا
**Translation:** It will be, on the Day they see it, as though they had not remained except an afternoon or a morning thereof.
**Key Point:** Even shorter - just evening or morning!

## SECTION 2: "Did We Not Give You Life Long Enough?"

### Ayah 7: 35:37 - Fatir (CRITICAL - Already drafted)
**Message:** People in Hell beg for second chance. Allah responds: "Did We not give you life long enough? The warner came to you. Now taste it!"
**Impact:** Destroys all excuses. You had TIME. You had GUIDANCE. No excuses accepted.

## SECTION 3: No Second Chances - Act NOW

### Ayah 8: 63:10 - Al-Munafiqun
**Arabic:** وَأَنفِقُوا۟ مِن مَّا رَزَقْنَـٰكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ فَيَقُولَ رَبِّ لَوْلَآ أَخَّرْتَنِىٓ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍۢ قَرِيبٍۢ فَأَصَّدَّقَ وَأَكُن مِّنَ ٱلصَّـٰلِحِينَ
**Translation:** And spend from what We have provided you before death approaches one of you and he says, "My Lord, if only You would delay me for a brief term so I would give charity and be among the righteous."
**Key Point:** At death, people will BEG for delay - just a little more time!

### Ayah 9: 63:11 - Al-Munafiqun
**Arabic:** وَلَن يُؤَخِّرَ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهَآ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌۢ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ
**Translation:** But never will Allah delay a soul when its time has come. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do.
**Key Point:** NO DELAY. When time comes, it's OVER. Act NOW.

## SECTION 4: What Are We Chasing?

### Ayah 10: 102:1-2 - At-Takathur
**Arabic:** أَلْهَىٰكُمُ ٱلتَّكَاثُرُ - حَتَّىٰ زُرْتُمُ ٱلْمَقَابِرَ
**Translation:** Competition in [worldly] increase diverts you - Until you visit the graves.
**Key Point:** We're DISTRACTED by accumulating more and more... until we DIE. Then it's too late!

### Ayah 11: 3:185 - Ali 'Imran
**Arabic:** وَمَا ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ إِلَّا مَتَـٰعُ ٱلْغُرُورِ
**Translation:** And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion.
**Key Point:** This entire life is DELUSION. Temporary enjoyment that tricks you.

## SECTION 5: Real-Life Example

**Scenario:** 
A successful businessman, 65 years old. Spent 40 years building his company. Worked 12-hour days. Accumulated wealth, properties, status. Prayed occasionally but never really pondered the Quran. Always said "I'll focus on religion when I retire."

One day, heart attack. On his deathbed, his entire 65 years flash before him like a dream. He thinks: "Where did all that time go? I spent decades chasing numbers in bank accounts. I built buildings that I can't take with me. I accumulated wealth I can't use now. But I neglected what Allah told me in the Quran. I didn't prepare for THIS moment."

Now imagine him on the Day of Judgment. Allah asks: "How long were you on earth?" He says: "It felt like... one day. Maybe less. It's all gone now like it never happened."

Then Allah asks: "Did I not give you 65 years? Did the Quran not come to you? Did you not have every Friday to hear reminders? What stopped you?"

No answer. Just regret.

**This could be YOU. Are you that businessman?** How old are you now? 30? 40? 50? Those years will vanish like they never existed. What are you doing with them?

---

## SECTION 6: Reflection Questions

1. **If you knew you would die tomorrow, what would you regret not doing today?** Why aren't you doing it now?

2. **When you're 70 years old looking back, will you wish you spent less time working and more time understanding the Quran?** Then why not change NOW?

3. **Imagine it's the Day of Judgment. Allah shows you a replay of your last week. How much time did you spend on dunya vs. preparing for akhirah?** What does that ratio tell you?

4. **If someone gave you $1 million but took away 10 years of your life, would you accept?** No? Then why do you waste years chasing money that won't benefit you after death?

5. **The Prophet will complain that his people abandoned the Quran. When he says that, will he be talking about YOU?**

## Summary Statement

**Your entire life - all those years, all those memories, all those achievements - will compress into what FEELS like a few hours on the Day of Judgment. Every birthday you celebrated, every goal you achieved, every worry you had - it will all seem like it happened just yesterday, or this morning.**

**The question is: When that moment comes and your life flashes before you feeling like just one day, will you be satisfied with how you spent it? Or will you be drowning in regret, begging for more time, only to hear: "Did We not give you life long enough?"**

**WAKE UP. The clock is ticking. Your "little" time on earth is running out.**
